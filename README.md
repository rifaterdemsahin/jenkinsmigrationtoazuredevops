# Migrating Jenkins Pipeline to Azure DevOps 🚀

In this post, I’ll walk you through a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** where I migrated a Jenkins pipeline to an Azure DevOps pipeline. By leveraging **Docker**, we’ll keep things isolated, modular, and scalable. This approach allows you to streamline your CI/CD processes and fully embrace Azure DevOps for more effective project management.

## 🔍 Why Move from Jenkins to Azure DevOps?

Jenkins is a solid CI/CD tool, but **Azure DevOps** offers integrated solutions, allowing better project management, traceability, and tighter security. By migrating, you’ll benefit from:

- Integrated Git repositories 🛠️
- Built-in testing and release pipelines 📦
- Cloud-native automation ☁️

## 🛠️ Jenkins Pipeline Setup

First, let’s take a look at our Jenkins pipeline running within Docker:

```bash
docker run \
  --name jenkins-poc \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \
  jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

In this scenario, we set up a simple CI process where Jenkins pulls the latest code, runs unit tests, and builds the Docker image.

## 🔄 Migrating to Azure DevOps

Now, let's transition that Jenkins pipeline into **Azure DevOps**. Here’s how we did it:

1. **Create a new Pipeline** in Azure DevOps 🏗️.
2. **Import Jenkins pipeline scripts** and convert them to YAML-based Azure DevOps pipelines 📜.
3. **Connect Azure Repos** for automated builds with each commit. For this, we created a `Dockerfile` and automated the build and deployment.

### 📄 Azure DevOps YAML Pipeline Example:

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: UseDocker@0
  inputs:
    containerRegistry: 'YourContainerRegistry'
    repository: 'YourRepo'
    command: 'build'
    Dockerfile: 'Dockerfile'
```

This pipeline mirrors what we initially had in Jenkins but is now fully integrated with **Azure DevOps**.

## 🚀 Key Takeaways

By moving from Jenkins to Azure DevOps, we’ve gained:

- Smoother integrations with **Azure cloud services** 🌐.
- Centralized pipeline management with built-in boards and repos 📊.
- Improved scalability with **cloud-native deployment models** ☁️.
